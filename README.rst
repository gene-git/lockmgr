Overview

lockmgr : Python Class implementing file locking

All git tags are signed with arch@sapience.com key which is available via WKD
or download from https://www.sapience.com/tech. Add the key to your package builder gpg keyring.
The key is included in the Arch package and the source= line with *?signed* at the end can be used
to verify the git tag.  You can also manually verify the signature

New / Interesting
==================

 * Tidy ups: PEP-8, PEP-257, PEP-484 PEP-561
 * improve reference API doc.
 * Add py.typed so type checkers like mypy can be used with the module.


###################
Using LockMgr Class
###################

Using the class is straightforward. Choose a file to use as the lockfile - avoid NFS mounts.
I find using */tmp* works well since its a *tmpfs* file system.

An sample application is available in the examples directory. To see it in action, 
simply run *test_lock.py* in 2 different terminals. One process will acquire the lock while
the other will wait until its released.

Typical usage:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from lockmgr import LockMgr

        lockdir = '/tmp/xxx'
        os.makedirs(lockdir, exist_ok=True)
        lockfile = os.path.join(lockdir, 'foo.lock')
        lockmgr = LockMgr(lockfile)

        ...

        # Acquire lock
        if lockmgr.acquire_lock(wait=True, timeout=30):
            # do stuff 
            ...

            # release lock
            lockmgr.release_lock()
       else:
            # failed to get lock
            ...

Research on file locking
########################

I share my notes and research on file locking. All code samples are available in the
examples/research directory.


Linux: C Implementations
========================

File Locking has linux kernel support via standard C library using fcntl().
The mechanism uses 'struct flock' as the communication mechanism with (posix) fcntl().

The standard locking mechanism uses F_SETLK. This lock lives at the process level
and is the original locking in linux.
Around 2015 or so 'open file desription' locks came to be via F_OFD_SETLK (See [1]_ and [2]_).
These are at the open file level. So while F_SETLK is not passed to child processes, OFD locks are.
And OFD locks remain attached to the open file handle. This can be enormously useful and
also surprising.

Posix locks are attached to (inode, pid) pair which means they work at the process level.
If thread opens same file, even tho has different file handle, when that thread closes
the fd, the lock is released for all threads in same process.

OFD locking was introduced to deal with this. Locking is attached to the "open file"
and not the PID.

linux also provides "lockf" which is a wrapper around fcntl() locks - should only be used
in simple cases and will interact with "normal" fcntl() locks - caveat emptor.

Summary:

 *  Posix Lock: fcntl() - F_SETLK
 *  OFD Lock: fcntl() - F_OFD_SETLK
 *  lockf - bah

NB. The flock struct contains l_pid - this MUST be 0 for OFD locks and PID for posix locks.

Its also worth noting that locking can be file system dependent. In particular NFS should
probably be avoided. Since my dominant use case is single machine, multiple process, I use
/tmp which is a TMPFS file system and works well.



Python
======

Python provides for same locking mechanisms - I recommend only 1 way for file locks in python.
Python library provides for:

 * fcntl.fcntl => do not use

As with C there is support for F_SETLK and F_OFD_SETLK.  While these work fine, they
require using 'struct' module to 'pack' and 'unpack' the C flock struct. To make this
work the caller must provide the sizes (coded with letters as per the python struct module)
of each element being packed.

The python 3.12 docs have examples [3]_, and while they may well work for a Sun workstation
or similar, if you have one, the struct element sizes dont seem correct for X86_64.

I provide a little C-program to print out the correct byte sizes which you can then
map to the python struct letter codes [4]_

This approach is brittle - its one thing when you are coding with your own
C structures, its another entirely when using system ones - these sizes should
be compiled into python - while these routines work I strongly recommend not using them
for this reason.

 * fcntl.lockf => do not use

Wrapper around fcntl() - in spite of name this is NOT C lockf() function.

 * fcntl.flock => *use this one*

Wrapper around fcntl with OFD support. i.e. this lock is associated with open file descriptor.
This is what I use and recommend.


Examples
========

C-code
======

Sample code for F_SETLK and F_OFD_SETLK
To compile:

.. code-block:: bash

   make

Builds 2 programs - *flock_sizes* and *c_lock_test*.

*flock_sizes* is used To print size of struct flock elements which provide the correct
sizes to use in python fcntl.fcntl approach.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./flock_sizes

The test program demonstrates locking with and without OFD.
To run the test progrm see the `Tests: c_lock_test`_ section below.

Tests: c_lock_test
==================

To run locking tests, use 2 terminals. Run c_lock_test in both.
The first will acquire lock while second will fail until first exits or is interrupted.

Test 1 : Using F_SETLK
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

      ./c_lock_test

Test 2 : Using F_OFD_SETLK
--------------------------

Repeat test but with argument to turn on OFD

.. code-block:: bash

     ./c_lock_test ofd

Test (1) and (2) both work.

Python : lock_fcntl
===================

F_SETLK and F_OFD_SETLK tests in python.
Run test in 2 terminals as above:

Test 3 : Using F_SETLK
--------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

     ./lock_fcntl.py

Test 4 : Using F_OFD_SETLK
--------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    ./lock_fcntl.py ofd

Test (3) and (4) both work.

Python : lock_flock
===================

This is what I am using.
As above, run test in 2 terminals.

Test 5 :
--------

.. code-block:: bash

     ./lock_fcntl.py

Test (5) works.

        rm -f dist/*
        /usr/bin/python -m build --wheel --no-isolation
        root_dest="/"
        ./scripts/do-install $root_dest

When running as non-root then set root_dest a user writable directory

Philosophy
==========

We follow the *live at head commit* philosophy. This means we recommend using the
